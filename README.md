# Public Responses Towards Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic

## Problem Statement:
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare industry and hospitals have garnered significant public attention, leading to extensive online discussions. Research in human resource management indicates that healthcare workers are significantly influenced by public perception; they feel motivated by appreciation but demoralized by ostracism. Specifically, they experience tension in public settings due to potential virus exposure. Negative public perceptions have been shown to reduce their work engagement and well-being, whereas positive reinforcement enhances these aspects. Despite this, there is a lack of research on the online narratives concerning healthcare workers, which could impact their well-being and, by extension, the healthcare system during this public health crisis. This project aims to analyze the emotions in online discussions about healthcare workers to better understand and guide positive online discourse, ultimately supporting healthcare professionals more effectively.

## Detailed Tasks to Perform:
- Develop a data crawler to capture tweets containing hashtags related to healthcare workers (including physicians, nurses, emergency medical personnel, dental professionals, medical and nursing students, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, hospital volunteers, and administrative staff) specifically during the COVID-19 period.
- Perform sentiment analysis to categorize tweets based on the emotions they express.
- Implement topic modeling to determine the subjects discussed in tweets associated with different emotions.
